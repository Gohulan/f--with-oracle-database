# f--with-oracle-database
To connect F# with an Oracle database, you can use the System.Data.OracleClient namespace in .NET. Here's a basic example of how you can connect to an Oracle database and execute a query:
To develop an F# application that connects to an Oracle database in Visual Studio, you can choose any of the following frameworks:

.NET Framework: This is a mature and well-established framework for building Windows desktop and server applications.

.NET Core: This is a newer and cross-platform framework for building modern applications that can run on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Both frameworks support F# and the System.Data.OracleClient namespace, so you can use either one to develop your application. The choice between the two frameworks depends on your specific needs and requirements, such as the target platforms you want to run on, the features you need, and so on.

If you're new to F# and Visual Studio, you can start by creating a new F# Console Application project in Visual Studio and following the example code I provided earlier.

You can add the System.Data.OracleClient namespace to your project in Visual Studio by using the following steps:

Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer and select "Manage NuGet Packages."

In the NuGet Package Manager window, select the "Browse" tab.

Search for "System.Data.OracleClient" and select the package in the search results.

Click the "Install" button to install the package and its dependencies.

Accept the license terms and click the "I Accept" button.

Wait for the installation to complete, and then close the NuGet Package Manager window.

In your code, add the following line at the top of your file to reference the System.Data.OracleClient namespace:
